Bias: How much does the model fit on average from the *truth*. We also assume that our expectation is computed on data 
Variance: How much does an estimator $\vec{\theta}$ deviate from the average of the estimator

1. Bias related to *truth*
2. Variance related to model 

Asymtopic properties:

Consistency: As $n \rightarrow \infty$ bias converges to 0.
